# Todo



## Plan

- [ ] discuss wether we should remove or keep shoelace branding
- [ ] understand wether we ship too many css-globals
- [ ] what happens with Box (a div) in HTML? Will all content/children end up in VDOM then??
- [ ] contact cory

## Tooling

- [ ] storybook: the nice color tools
- [ ] storybook: install, as its needed for regression testing anyway?
- [ ] package, so we can import from `@lego/klik-ui/` and `@lego/klik-ui/react` (instead of `@lego/klik-ui/dist/react` etc)
- [ ] add details to Parity table
- [ ] design-token import script
- [ ] make it easy to update from upstream
- [x] update plop templates
- [x] rename things to 'klik'
- [ ] rename main build 'klik' (still 'shoelace' - and thats used a couple of places)
- [ ] figure out @lego npm stuff
- [ ] @lego js cdn?
