Thanks to the popularity of frameworks such as Angular, Vue, and React, component-driven development has become a part of our every day lives. Components help us encapsulate styles and behaviors into reusable building blocks. They make a lot of sense in terms of design, development, and testing.

Unfortunately, _framework-specific_ components fail us in a number of ways:

- You can only use them in the framework they're designed for üîí
- Their lifespan is limited to that of the framework's ‚è≥
- New frameworks/versions can lead to breaking changes, requiring substantial effort to update components üò≠

Web components solve these problems. They're [supported by all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1), they're framework-agnostic, and they're [part of the standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), so we know they'll be supported for many years to come.


## Quick Start

Add the following code to your page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@%VERSION%/dist/themes/light.css">
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shoelace-style/shoelace@%VERSION%/dist/shoelace.js"></script>
```

Now you have access to all of Shoelace's components! Try adding a button:

```html
<klik-button>Click me</klik-button>
```

This will load all of Shoelace's components, but you should probably only load the ones you're actually using. To learn how, or for other ways to install Shoelace, refer to the [installation instructions](getting-started/installation).


## Browser Support

Tested in the latest two versions of the following browsers.

<img src="/assets/images/edge.png" alt="Edge" width="64" height="64">
<img src="/assets/images/firefox.png" alt="Firefox" width="64" height="64">
<img src="/assets/images/opera.png" alt="Opera" width="64" height="64">
<img src="/assets/images/safari.png" alt="Safari" width="64" height="64">

Critical bug fixes in earlier versions will be addressed based on their severity and impact.

If you need to support IE11 or pre-Chromium Edge, this library isn't for you.
